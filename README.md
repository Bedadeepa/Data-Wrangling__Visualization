# Data Wrangling </br>
- Data wrangling is the process of removing errors and combining complex data sets to make them more accessible and easier to analyze. Due to the rapid expansion of the amount of data and data sources available today, storing and organizing large quantities of data for analysis is becoming increasingly necessary. 
- In these Projects I have used Pandas for wrangling process. 
# Data Visualization </br>
- It is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.
- In the Projects I have used Different type of plots To visualize the information of the data 
- some plots from my projects
